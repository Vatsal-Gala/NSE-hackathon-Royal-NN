## Problem Statement: 
Traders manually adjust algo parameters in response to progress metrics, prevailing market Data and Static Reference data; this is manually intensive and needs to be done in a very short time span hence limiting scalability. Solve for adjusting Algo parameters on the fly like a human trader would have done.

## Problem Definition:
The solution is to create a model that aims to maximize profits to clients and thereby,brokerage firms.The user interface 
accepts details from the user related to the Company where he/she wishes to invest,and the quantity of shares that he/she 
wants to buy.Using the Past records of the Company,the possible opening price,high value and low value for the next day are 
predicted.
